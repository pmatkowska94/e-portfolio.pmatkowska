                  Research Methods and Professional Practice Module Projects
                </h2>
<p>During the Research Methods module, I engaged in additional activities that deepened my understanding of the subject. These included:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reasoning Quiz – to enhance my understanding of the differences between inductive and deductive research methods.</li>
  <li>Case Study on Privacy – accompanied by several reflective questions to apply theoretical concepts in a practical context.</li>

	<h3>The Case</h3>
	<p>
	''Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a 
		researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.	
	</p>
	<p>Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, 
		so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.'' '' (University of Essex, n.d.)</p>
	<p>Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?</p>
	<p>1.	If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?</p>
	<p>If Ricardo is not formally authorized to determine who may access sensitive data, releasing the names and addresses would constitute a serious breach of confidentiality. Even having access 
		to information does not grant him the right to share it outside of his responsibilities. Releasing such data without permission would not only misuse his position but also disregard 
		the principle of informed consent, as individuals involved have not agreed to their data being disclosed. This action could also expose Ricardo and his department to legal and ethical 
		consequences, damaging trust and accountability. </p>
	<p>2. Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?</p>
	<p>If Ricardo held the responsibility to determine access, he would still face multiple ethical considerations before deciding whether Beth should receive the data. Firstly, he would
		need to ensure that sharing personally identifiable information aligns with data protection regulations and institutional ethics. Individuals whose data is being requested should 
		ideally give consent for it to be used in this way. Furthermore, Ricardo must consider the purpose behind Beth's request and whether the potential scientific benefit justifies the
		privacy risks involved. Decisions of this nature should follow transparent procedures and established institutional guidelines, rather than relying solely on personal judgment.
		In any case, such a decision would likely require formal ethical review or an approved data-sharing agreement.</p>
	<p>3. Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? 
		What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?</p>
	<p>Whether Beth should be permitted to contact the individuals hinges on both ethical and legal considerations. People have the right to control their participation in any research,
		and their autonomy must be respected. Revealing names from records, even for academic purposes, may breach confidentiality agreements and erode public trust in the institution’s 
		data protection standards. The Records department must operate within the boundaries of applicable laws and internal policies, such as GDPR, and should not act without proper 
		safeguards. If contact is deemed necessary, it may be more appropriate for the department itself to reach out to individuals on Beth’s behalf, rather than disclosing their 
		identities directly. </p>
	<p>4. Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond.
		Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?</p>
	<p>In this situation, ethical standards clearly prohibit interpreting silence as consent. Non-response cannot be assumed to reflect agreement, and using data from those who have not explicitly 
		permitted it would be inappropriate. Although working with only the group that gave consent might introduce bias, it is the only ethically approach. Beth may need to redesign her 
		study to suit the smaller sample, explore alternative recruitment methods to improve the response rate, or consider working with anonymized or aggregated data that does not require 
		direct contact. </p>

  <li>Self-assessment Quiz – focused on project management and risk management, which helped consolidate my knowledge in these areas.</li>
