                <h1>Reflection Data Visualisation</h1>
                
                <h3>Facts</h3>
                
                <p>When I began the data science course at the University of Essex, I was not entirely sure what being a data scientist 
                  entailed. According to the SAS team (n.d.), a data scientist's role involves organising and analysing data using various 
                  software tools, while also effectively communicating insights to stakeholders, who may range from highly technical to 
                  non-technical individuals. Initially, I believed that computing skills would be the most crucial. However, as I 
                  progressed through this module and previous ones, I realized that the most important skill for a data scientist is 
                  the ability to extract hidden insights from data and communicate them effectively. </p>
                
                <p>Communication plays a key role in presenting findings to people from various backgrounds (Mucke, 2022). Early on, 
                  I found that communication was my biggest challenge, even more than programming. Programming, for me, is easier to 
                  learn through practice and using different tools. However, communicating data insights is much more complex. Data 
                  visualization plays a vital role here, as it makes complex patterns such as clusters and outliers more understandable 
                  to people from different backgrounds. Visuals communicate the story behind the data far better than tables of raw numbers 
                  (Munzer, 2019).</p>
                
                <h3>Feelings and Findings</h3>
                
                <p>Before this module, I had not considered the principles behind data visualization, but the initial 
                  discussions opened my eyes to how crucial it is. After creating my first post, I started recognizing 
                  how various industries apply these principles to make data more accessible. Understanding how to
                  communicate findings visually was a key lesson for me, and it ties deeply into communication and 
                  literacy skills, which are essential for translating data insights into actionable recommendations.
                  When preparing for the first assignment, I faced challenges due to my limited knowledge of marketing. 
                  I often wondered if my visualizations were truly relevant to the marketing context, and whether they 
                  would provide meaningful insights for those in the field. My understanding of building predictive 
                  models was also limited, though I am confident that with further reading and practice, this is an area 
                  I can improve.</p>
                
                <p>For the second assignment, which involved building a dashboard, I collaborated with a 
                  sales specialist, simulating the real-world role of a data scientist working alongside a business expert. 
                  This experience was invaluable in improving my interpersonal and communication skills, as I needed input
                  from the specialist to understand what was important from a business perspective. Working together, we 
                  created a dashboard for the e-commerce team using real sales data (Figure 1). It was a demanding process 
                  but very satisfying, as the dashboard had an impact on the sales team’s analysis. Our collaboration 
                  combined my data understanding and programming skills with the specialist’s sales expertise, leading to 
                  new ideas for the team’s future analyses. This was a great example of problem-solving and applying 
                  critical thinking to bridge the gap between data and business needs.</p>
                
                <p>It was also exciting to see how my visualizations evolved as I dedicated more time to learning about 
                  data visualization principles. </p>
                
                <p> I am now much more confident using various techniques to present my findings. I have worked with 
                  tools like R, Tableau, and Excel, and learned how to more effectively communicate data insights through 
                  graphs.</p>
                
                <p>However, I have faced several challenges along the way. One of the key difficulties was ensuring
                  that the visualizations were not only visually appealing but also accurate in representing the data 
                  without causing misinterpretation. Choosing the right type of chart or graph for the specific data and 
                  audience was another challenge, as different visualizations can lead to different 
                  interpretations (Wong, 2010).</p>
                
                <p>Moreover, maintaining an appropriate balance between simplicity and detail in visualizations presented 
                  a consistent challenge. It was often difficult to prevent overwhelming the audience with excessive 
                  information while ensuring sufficient context was provided to present the data meaningful and 
                  insightful.</p>
                
                <p>Throughout this module, I developed not only personal skills but also technical ones. My IT and 
                  digital skills improved as I learned to use R for visualizations, slowly replacing Excel as my primary 
                  tool at workspace. In the R&D team I work with, numeracy and research skills are vital, and this module 
                  has allowed me to sharpen these abilities. My daily tasks involve analysing data and critically 
                  evaluating findings, so deepening my critical thinking and analysis skills alongside with building 
                  a programming skills for creating a visuals and presentation and communication ability was particularly 
                  beneficial.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, I have gained a deeper understanding of the ethical responsibilities that come with data 
                  analysis. Ethical awareness is a fundamental aspect of the data science profession, ensuring that data 
                  is handled responsibly, findings are communicated transparently, and privacy is respected. Working with 
                  real sales data and collaborating with an e-commerce specialist exposed me to the challenges of 
                  maintaining data privacy, particularly when dealing with sensitive customer information. This experience 
                  highlighted the complexity of balancing the need for detailed analysis with strict compliance to privacy 
                  laws and ethical standards, such as GDPR (Wolford, N.D.).</p>
                
                <h3>Future</h3>
                
                <p>Reflecting on my data analysis skills and statistical knowledge, I feel that I have made significant 
                  progress, especially in applying analytical techniques to real-world datasets. However, I acknowledge 
                  that I still have room to grow, particularly in advanced statistical modelling and more complex techniques
                  like machine learning. Furthermore, I recognize that I still need to improve my time management, 
                  especially when balancing complex tasks. I also plan to take additional courses to enhance my presentation
                  and communication skills, which are critical for my future career in R&D field.</p>
                
                <p>Summarise, applying the four F’s of active reviewing (Facts, Feelings, Findings and Future) helped 
                  me gain a deeper understanding of my journey during this module (The University of Edinburgh, 2018). 
                  My journey through this module has greatly expanded my understanding of the role of a data scientist 
                  and the wide range of skills required to succeed in the field. Initially, I believed that technical 
                  computing skills were the most important aspect of data science. However, I have learned that the ability
                  to extract valuable insights from data and communicate those insights effectively is equally crucial. 
                  Through my experiences working on various assignments, particularly in collaboration with a sales 
                  specialist, I have enhanced my communication and interpersonal skills, which are essential for 
                  bridging the gap between data analysis and business needs. </p>
                
                <p>Additionally, to ensure continuous growth (The Open University, 2024), I developed a Professional 
                  Development Plan (PDP) skills matrix based on feedback from my team and the e-commerce specialist for 
                  whom I created the dashboard. This matrix served as the foundation for building an action plan to guide
                  my ongoing professional growth. </p>
