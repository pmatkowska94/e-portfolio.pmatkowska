                <h2>
                  How the Machine Learning Module Shaped My Professional and Personal Growth
                </h2>
		<h3>Facts </h3>
              <p>
                Before starting the machine learning (ML) module, I had a preconceived notion that it would be extremely
								complicated and challenging. People around me often
								reinforced this idea, describing it as almost something
								like "black magic."  My initial understanding of ML was
								limited to its definition as a branch of artificial 
								intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to learn 
								from data and experience for predictions (Crabtree, 2024).
	      </p>
								<p>
The module was well-structured and provided clear guidance, enabling me to grasp the usefulness of ML and its practical
								applications within my role as a bioprocess engineer. 
								I learned that ML tools can analyse large datasets, 
								identify patterns, predict critical process parameters,
								and optimize operations effectively (Helleckes et al., 2023).
								The supervised learning paradigm proved particularly relevant
								to my work, as it involves detecting relationships between
								inputs and outputs, facilitating accurate predictions on
								unseen data.
									</p>
								<p>
The first group assignment was an opportunity to collaborate with peers, each bringing diverse skills and perspectives.
								This collaboration deepened my knowledge while teaching me
								the importance of balancing individual contributions with 
								collective goals. I also learned how to resolve conflicts 
								constructively and adapt to dynamic team dynamics. This 
								enriching experience improved my interpersonal skills and
								highlighted the importance of clear communication and mutual
								respect for achieving shared objectives. Feedback from the
								team suggested that I could further enhance my participation
								by contributing additional insights and engaging more 
								actively in discussions, particularly around challenges and 
								areas for development, which I recognized as an opportunity
								for personal growth.
									</p>
								<p>
Later in the module, I undertook a more advanced task: building an artificial neural network for an image recognition
								project. This proved challenging due to my limited practical
								experience with Python. However, I independently completed 
								the "Neural Network Models for Object Recognition" project,
								focusing on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
								for image classification. The project involved several
								stages, including dataset preprocessing, designing the CNN
								architecture, parameter tuning, training the model, and 
								evaluating its performance. I used Python to implement the 
								model, prioritizing accuracy while addressing challenges 
								such as overfitting and optimizing training efficiency.
									</p>
								<p>
This hands-on experience reinforced my understanding of the iterative nature of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in deep
								learning, where continuous refinement and adjustments are
								crucial for achieving optimal results. It also highlighted 
								the importance of customizing model design to address 
								specific problems rather than relying solely on predefined
								architectures. Completing the project independently enhanced
								both my problem-solving abilities and my confidence in
								managing complex technical tasks.
								</p>
		<h3> Feelings</h3>
                <p>
At the start of the machine learning module, I felt a mix of intimidation and apprehension. The way others described ML 
			as something almost mystical I doubted my ability to grasp the concepts. As I began the module,
			these feelings of uncertainty gradually shifted to curiosity and fascination. The structured and 
			clear organization of the module helped me build confidence and realize the practicality of ML,
			particularly in my work as a bioprocess engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
The group assignment evoked a sense of challenge. Collaborating with peers was enriching and rewarding, but at times, I 
			felt unsure about how best to contribute or articulate my ideas. I also appreciated the 
			constructive feedback from my peers as a valuable opportunity for growth, which motivated me 
			to focus on improving my teamwork and communication skills in everyday life.
                </p> 
<p>
When it came to building the artificial neural network independently, I initially felt overwhelmed. My limited experience
	with Python and the technical demands of the project made me question my knowledge. However, as I progressed
	through each stage of the project, conducting in-depth research and exploring scientific texts to deepen my
	understanding of concepts like dataset preprocessing, CNN design, and performance optimization, I developed 
	a growing sense of accomplishment. It was the first real-world problem project that I was able to complete, 
	which made me feel incredibly excited and proud of my achievement. Despite the challenges, the project ultimately
	gave me a deep sense of pride and confidence in my abilities. The satisfaction of overcoming difficulties and 
	completing the project alone reinforced my belief in my problem-solving skills and inspired me to take on more 
	complex tasks in the future.
</p>
               <h3>Findings</h3>
<p>
	Applying the four F’s of active reviewing (Facts, Feelings, Findings and Future) for this reflection helped me 
	gain a deeper understanding of my experience and feelings during this module (The University of Edinburgh, 2018)
</p>
								<p>
									From my experience in the module, I have come to 
									appreciate that machine learning is a powerful tool
									for analysing large datasets, identifying patterns,
									predicting critical process parameters, and 
									optimizing processes, making it highly relevant to
									bioprocess engineering. I also recognize that there 
									are numerous ML methods with potential applications 
									in my field.
									<p>
										Collaboration in group assignments provided an opportunity to learn 
										from diverse perspectives and develop interpersonal skills, including communication, 
										conflict resolution, and balancing individual and collective goals. Feedback from team 
										members highlighted areas for improvement, such as engaging more actively in discussions, 
										which are crucial for personal development.
										<p> 
											Completing a neural network project independently on which was a real-world problem
											enhanced my problem-solving skills and boosted my confidence in tackling complex technical
											challenges. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of making thoughtful design choices
											to optimise model performance.
										</p>
		<h3>Future</h3>
<p>
	Building on my experience with the machine learning module, I plan to further explore the potential applications
	of ML in bioprocess engineering, particularly in optimizing process parameters and improving efficiency. I aim to
	deepen my knowledge of various ML techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning methods, to address 
	specific challenges in my field. Expanding my expertise in Python programming and ML frameworks will be a key focus
	to enhance my technical proficiency. I also intend to seek opportunities for applying ML to real-world problems in 
	my work environment, such as developing predictive models for process optimization or automating data analysis
	workflows. 
</p>
								<p>
								With my master’s degree nearing completion in a few months, 
									I have already begun exploring potential topics for
									my final project. I plan to focus on a subject related to machine learning 
								 that I can directly implement in my work environment. I believe this 
									approach would not only be a valuable contribution to my personal 
									development and career growth but also accelerate the evolution of my 
									workplace by enabling more automated process planning and precise 
									predictions, replacing the trial-and-error approach currently in use.
									
								</p>
								<p>
									Ultimately, my goal is to seamlessly integrate ML into my professional 
									toolkit, leveraging it to drive innovation and improve outcomes in my role 
									as a member of the R&D team.
