# Evaluation of the final project (Unit 11) vs. the initial project proposal (Unit 6) and Explaination of the impact on my professional/personal development.

</p>
The project proposal in Unit 6 served as an excellent foundation and template for the final project in Module 11. Understanding the client profile and their needs is, in my opinion, 
a prerequisite for building an efficient database model. We used a simple example, an online shop. Before creating entities and attributes, we brainstormed about the relevant data for 
an online store. As the project progressed, new questions arose, such as how to handle certain types of information, whether we needed specific entities, and the relationships between the data.
</p><p>
The project proposal from Unit 6 highlighted the importance and challenges of data cleaning to ensure that only relevant data is stored and processed. The feedback we received was generally
positive but also pointed out several areas for improvement, such as providing more details in figures and charts. This feedback was invaluable for creating the final project for Unit 11. 
The final project expanded to include evaluations of data models and designs, as well as considerations for DBMS, legal, and compliance requirements. This experience underscored the significance 
of laws and compliance related to business data collected by the online shop and the necessity of meeting these standards.
</p><p>
Overall, my experience with database modeling taught me that extensive knowledge of law, compliance, and data management pipelines is crucial. However, understanding customer needs and
identifying the data required for business purposes and analytics is even more important for leveraging data-driven decision-making.

# Reflection

<p>
The Deciphering Big Data module was an excellent experience, significantly enhancing my knowledge of data wrangling. Starting with the first unit, which expanded my understanding
of big data technologies, was extraordinarily important for my professional development. I was aware of the vast amounts of data gathered in the modern world, such as sensor data 
during pharmaceutical production, and how it often goes unused for process improvement. However, I did not realize the extent to which everyday items rely on data and connectivity
in our modern world.
</p><p>
Discussion 1 on IoT highlighted its profound impact on the modern world by connecting a wide range of devices to the internet, enabling data collection and automation to enhance efficiency 
and reduce costs in sectors like healthcare and manufacturing (Borgini, 2023), (Petnaik, 2023), (Flavin, 2022). This discussion underscored the importance of the data science profession. 
Moreover, learning about the significant challenges of IoT implementation, including cybersecurity risks, interoperability issues, and increased costs for skilled personnel and data management 
(Borgini, 2023), (Petnaik, 2023),(IIoT World, 2022), further emphasized the critical role of data science in addressing these challenges.
  </p><p>
As I progressed through the module, I delved deeper into the data management pipeline. I realized that an effective data management pipeline is essential for transforming raw data into valuable 
insights, ensuring accuracy, security, and utility for decision-making (Dobriyal, 2024). Capturing data from various sources and maintaining high-quality, real-time datasets improves 
responsiveness (Haworth, 2023), (Munappy et al., 2020) but demands significant computational resources, potentially affecting accuracy (Chiranjiv, 2024), (Bell, 2023). Comprehensive data 
cleaning techniques enhance efficiency and security (Vitasek, 2023), (Michener, 2015) by reducing errors, but they must be maintained regularly to prevent inaccuracies. Systematic data 
cleaning is crucial for reliable analysis and accurate decision-making, supported by advanced analytics and continuous training. Although I had read that data science involves extensive
data cleaning, I did not fully understand this until I started this module. It provided crucial insights into the data management pipeline, revealing the inconsistencies in gathered data 
that can significantly reduce business efficiency or even lead to legal complications.
</p><p>
The feedback given in Unit 6 for our group work prompted me to delve deeper into the implications of correctly defined relationships in the database model. These relationships enable effective
customer relationship management, personalized marketing, and detailed order analysis by tracking multiple orders per customer and linking each order to specific products. This structure supports
inventory and sales analysis, product tracking, and supplier management. Additionally, linking support tickets to customers enhances customer service operations (Guerola-Navarro, 2024), 
(Ahmed, 2024), (Constantinos, 2003). Overall, these relationships ensure data integrity, efficient data management, enhanced analytics, improved customer experience, and operational efficiency, 
which can have significant positive implications for any business.
  </p><p>
The DBD module and final project enabled me to explore a wide range of database management systems (DBMS). SQL and NoSQL databases offer a variety of functionalities suited to different business
needs, each with its own pros and cons that must be considered before making a choice. For our relational database, we chose PostgreSQL, which is an excellent DBMS for relational databases
(Airbyte, 2023), (Fashakin, 2023), (Devathon, 2021), although other systems like MySQL are also viable options. As a biotechnologist, I manage vast amounts of data, including sensor readings
and image data, which are crucial for advancing research and development. The ability to efficiently store, process, and analyze this diverse data is vital for making informed, data-driven
decisions that impact experimental outcomes and operational strategies(Hop, 2023), (Oliveira, 2019). To stay at the forefront of this field, I continually explore various Database Management
Systems (DBMS) to find the best fit for my needs. Each DBMS offers unique functionalities and optimizations, so understanding their strengths and limitations helps in selecting the most 
effective tools for handling complex datasets. 
</p><p>
The module also highlighted the critical importance of legal and compliance considerations in the data science field. In today's data-driven world, we often manage sensitive personal information 
and vital business data, making adherence to legal standards crucial. Compliance with regulations such as GDPR is essential for protecting personal and operational data. Regular training on EU 
data safety requirements and frequent audits are necessary to ensure continuous legal compliance.
The recommendations section of the final project highlighted the many factors to consider when building and managing a database. It emphasized the importance of compliance and effective database 
operation. Protecting customer data is vital for maintaining trust and ensuring legal compliance, necessitating robust cybersecurity measures and regular security audits (Abrahams et al., 2024). 
High data quality and integrity are crucial for accurate decision-making, supported by efficient data entry, cleaning, and validation processes (Bammdi et al., 2024). Additionally, leveraging 
scalable technologies (Mullins, 2023), (Scylla, 2024) and ensuring comprehensive documentation and training (Tobin, 2024), (TRIGYN Technologies, 2024) are key to enhancing data practices and 
maintaining compliance.
  </p><p>
One area I found lacking in the module was practical experience with Python programming and code writing. Despite the strong coverage of data wrangling concepts, the module provided limited 
hands-on coding exercises. I struggled with writing effective code and realized I need more practice to gain expertise. To address this gap, I sought additional courses on Python and SQL, but
balancing full-time work with studying has made time management challenging.
    </p><p>
Overall, the knowledge I gained from the module and the projects has been invaluable and crucial for my future career as a data scientist in the pharmaceutical field. The insights into data
wrangling, database management, and compliance are fundamental to my professional growth. Moving forward, I plan to continue enhancing my programming skills through additional exercises and 
coursework, as mastering coding is essential for any data scientist. My interest in database design and DBMS will drive me to explore these areas further, ensuring I stay updated with the
latest technologies and best practices. This ongoing learning will help me effectively manage and analyze data, ultimately contributing to more informed decision-making in the pharmaceutical
industry.
