                <h2>
                  How the Research Methods and Professional Practice Module Shaped My Professional and Personal Growth
                </h2>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                This reflection was developed using the Four F’s of Active Reviewing model, Facts, Feelings, Findings, and Future (The University of Edinburgh, 2018), to critically 
                evaluate my learning experience during the Research Methods module of my Master of Data Science programme. This approach helped me systematically explore not only what 
                I did and how I felt throughout the module, but also what I discovered and how I plan to apply these insights moving forward. 
	      </p>
								
		<h3>Facts </h3>
              <p>
                At the start of the Research Methods module, I reviewed the three-month schedule and was immediately struck by the volume and variety of written assignments we were 
                expected to complete. These included a research proposal, an academic literature review, several reflective tasks, and ethical case analyses. While I initially believed I had 
                a solid understanding of ethics in computing, the module’s deep and nuanced approach quickly challenged that assumption and expanded my perspective.
	      </p>
								<p>
One of the first assignments was a reflective piece on AI ethics, where I explored the evolving nature of ethical frameworks in relation to regulations like the GDPR, AI Act, 
                  and Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI. I examined key concerns such as transparency, bias, misinformation, and the complexities introduced by generative AI 
                  (Alanazi et al. 2025; Ferrara, 2024; Li, Ruijs & Lu, 2022; Novelli et al., 2024). This helped me see ethics not as fixed rules, but as a dynamic system adapting to
                  technological change.
									</p>
								<p>
In parallel, I conducted a literature review on the use of machine learning in drug safety, covering topics like adverse drug reactions, drug-drug interactions, and toxicity prediction. 
                  Although initially overwhelming, the task helped me appreciate literature reviews as essential tools for identifying research gaps and synthesising diverse perspectives.
                
									</p>
								<p>
One of the module’s core components was the development of a research proposal. I chose a topic at the intersection of biotechnology and machine learning. This project investigated whether 
                  machine learning models trained on well-established CHO datasets could be adapted to predict outcomes in iPSC-based systems, fragile but promising cell cultures 
                  (Borys et al., 2021). The proposal required me to explain complex biotech concepts in accessible terms, allowing me to strengthen my ability to communicate scientific 
                  ideas across disciplines.
									</p>
								<p>
Additional ethical case studies included an analysis of software accessibility and a review of data collection practices. These exercises deepened my understanding of how professional 
                  codes, like those from the ACM and BCS, relate to real-world responsibilities in software and data ethics.
								</p>
		<h3> Feelings</h3>
                <p>
At the beginning of the Research Methods module, I felt a mix of anxiety and apprehension. Seeing the list of upcoming assignments, particularly the research proposal, literature review, 
                  and ethical reflections, left me feeling overwhelmed. The workload seemed intense, and I initially doubted my ability to manage everything alongside my professional 
                  responsibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
I started the module with the impression that I had a firm grasp of computing ethics. However, as I delved into the assignments, I realized just how complex and evolving this field really is.
                  The exploration of legal frameworks gave me a more grounded understanding, and the ethical debates around generative AI, accessibility, and data consent which I found to be a valuable and 
                  interesting area of exploration.
                </p> 
<p>
Working on the research proposal brought a different kind of excitement. I felt deeply motivated by the chance to connect machine learning with bioprocess engineering, two areas I am truly passionate about. 
  It was rewarding to develop a project idea that felt both innovative and personally meaningful.
</p>
                <p>
                  As the module progressed, my initial stress gradually gave way to engagement, confidence, and even enjoyment. I became more comfortable navigating academic literature,
                  more thoughtful in ethical discussions, and more confident in shaping ideas for my capstone project. 
</p>

               <h3>Findings</h3>
<p>
Reflecting on my experience in this module, I discovered several important insights that significantly contributed to both my academic development and professional growth. One of the key 
  findings was the recognition that ethics in computing is not static or purely theoretical, but a dynamic, evolving field that intersects with law, policy, and technological innovation. I
  realized how seemingly minor ethical oversights in data handling can have major implications for user trust, transparency, and regulatory response. 
</p>
                <p>
The literature review, proved to be a powerful tool for expanding my knowledge and critical thinking. By studying the role of ML in drug safety, I became familiar with the breadth of its applications, 
                  but more importantly, I learned how to evaluate research quality, spot methodological limitations, and identify gaps in the existing body of knowledge. This process helped me better 
                  appreciate the purpose of scholarly work and its relevance to industry challenges.
</p>
                <p>
Developing my research proposal was another transformative experience. It gave me the opportunity to integrate my background in biotechnology with my growing skills in data science. I learned how
                  to construct a research question, set clear objectives, and design a practical methodology, all while communicating technical ideas in a way that is accessible to interdisciplinary
                  audiences.
</p>
                <p>
Finally, I learned that good research does not exist in isolation. It requires clear ethical boundaries, effective project planning, and a curiosity-driven mindset. The module taught me that research 
                  is not just about generating answers, but about asking meaningful, relevant questions and doing so with integrity, creativity, and responsibility.
</p>

		<h3>Future</h3>
<p>
	Building on the experience gained during the Research Methods module and by the insights from my personal SWOT analysis and PDP, I now have a clearer direction for my academic and professional 
  development. The module confirmed that my strengths lie in bridging scientific expertise in biotechnology with emerging tools from data science, particularly in applied, research-driven contexts. 
  It also highlighted areas I wish to further develop, such as deepening my programming skills, improving methodological design, and enhancing my engagement in interdisciplinary discussions.
</p>
                <p>
	Looking ahead, I plan to carry this into my capstone project, which will expand on the research proposal I developed focusing on predictive bioreactor scale-up using machine learning. 
                  This project not only aligns with my scientific background and professional role as a bioprocess engineer but also reflects my long-term goal of leveraging data science 
                  to innovate in biotechnology. My experience in this and other modules has shown me how critical it is to approach complex challenges with both analytical rigor and ethical
                  responsibility.
</p>
                <p>
	From an ethical standpoint, I intend to stay informed about evolving AI governance frameworks, particularly in Europe, and ensure that my work remains aligned with principles of fairness, 
                  transparency, and accountability. The Research Methods module has reinforced the importance of not only complying with ethical standards but actively contributing to a responsible 
                  research culture. My future goal is to apply what I have learned across this MSc programme to drive innovation in bioprocess development, grounded in science, powered by data, and guided 
                  by ethics.
