                <h2>Ethical Challenges in Data Collection: Lessons from the Cases of CubeYou and Google</h2>

<p>In today’s data-driven world, the ethical management of personal information has become a central concern. Two notable cases, CubeYou’s exploitation of Facebook quiz data and Google’s Screenwise Meter initiative, illustrate the risks and ethical challenges associated with opaque data collection practices. Although both operated within loosely defined legal frameworks, the methods used and the lack of transparency surrounding the intent behind data use highlight critical shortcomings in digital ethics, informed consent, and data governance.</p>

<h3>Case 1: CubeYou and the Facebook Quiz Scandal</h3>
<p>The first case involves CubeYou, a data analytics firm that used a Facebook personality quiz titled You Are What You Like, originally developed in collaboration with Cambridge University for academic purposes, to collect user data. Although Facebook had approved the quiz strictly for research, CubeYou allegedly misused the platform by selling the data to advertisers for targeted marketing (Castillo, 2018). This practice mirrored the tactics previously linked to Cambridge Analytica (Von Blazekovic, 2018). Data was extracted not only from quiz participants but also from their Facebook friends, creating a wider web of unauthorized data access. While CubeYou claimed that consent was obtained, many users were unaware that their data was being monetized rather than used for academic analysis (Castillo, 2018; Von Blazekovic, 2018).</p>
<p>The central ethical concern in this case was deception. Users assumed they were contributing to scientific research, but instead, they were subjected to data mining for commercial benefit. Despite the existence of a consent mechanism, the lack of transparency undermined the integrity of that consent. Following a CNBC investigation, Facebook responded by suspending all CubeYou apps and acknowledged that it had limited visibility into how third-party developers were using user data (Castillo, 2018). Cambridge University distanced itself from CubeYou, clarifying that no predictive algorithms were shared and that the firm had overstated their collaboration (Castillo, 2018).</p>


<h3>Case 2: Google’s Screenwise Meter Program</h3>
<p>A similar misuse of data occurred in Google’s Screenwise Meter program, marketed as a voluntary initiative to gather insights into user behaviour in exchange for modest rewards, typically gift cards worth around $20 (Sydney & Kelley, 2019; Whittaker, Constine, Lunden, 2019). Participants installed VPN-based apps or browser extensions, which granted Google extensive access to digital activity, including screen content, browser history, and app usage, even on encrypted websites (Sydney & Kelley, 2019). Some users were provided with special routers that monitored all internet-connected devices in the household (Whittaker, Constine, Lunden, 2019). In this context, individuals including minors and household guests were often tracked without their explicit consent.</p>
<p>Screenwise Meter’s most controversial move was its use of Apple’s Enterprise Certificate to distribute the iOS app outside of the App Store, in violation of Apple’s internal-use-only policy (Whittaker, Constine, Lunden, 2019). When questioned by media, Google responded swiftly by disabling the app, a move that helped it avoid a prolonged backlash similar to that faced by Facebook in related incidents (Whittaker, Constine, Lunden, 2019). Despite assurances of transparency, the sheer scale of surveillance paired with a weak incentive system suggests a significant imbalance between what users received and what they surrendered (Sydney & Kelley, 2019; Whittaker, Constine, Lunden, 2019).</p>


<h3>Conclusion<</h3>
<p>Both cases underscore recurring ethical themes: manipulation of consent, lack of transparency, and imbalance of power. Even if these practices were not illegal at the time due to vague data-sharing policies, they exposed critical regulatory gaps and helped fuel broader discussions that eventually led to the development of stronger data protection laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>From a professional ethics standpoint, these examples underline the responsibility of data scientists, marketers, and platform developers to prioritize transparency, fairness, and user autonomy. The trust placed in digital platforms cannot be sustained if users are deceived or inadequately informed about how their data is collected and used. Ethical responsibility must go beyond mere legal compliance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, ethical responsibility in the digital era extends beyond legal compliance. The CubeYou and Google Screenwise Meter cases serve as reminders that when trust is lost, reputations suffer, and regulations follow. For data professionals, platform developers, and marketers, ethical data use, transparency, and respect for user autonomy are not optional, they are the foundation of sustainable and responsible digital innovation.</p>
