# API Security Requirements

<p>
  
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are fundamental to innovation in the modern app-driven world. They are indispensable across various industries, including banking, 
retail, transportation, IoT, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities. By their very nature, APIs expose and sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), 
rendering them attractive targets for cyberattacks. Therefore, ensuring the security of APIs is critical for sustaining rapid innovation (OWSAP, N.D.).

In the domains of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science, APIs hold significant importance. They enable access to extensive datasets, pre-trained AI models, 
  and AI-powered services, thereby substantially enhancing AI and data science projects(Custer, 2024). The primary benefits include:
•	Availability of extensive datasets for training machine learning models
•	Incorporation of AI models, into applications
•	Real-time data streams for AI applications needing up-to-date information (Custer, 2024).

With the increasing threat of cyberattacks, securing APIs has become essential for businesses. This urgency is underscored by numerous security reports highlighting the 
vulnerability of web APIs. (Curity, N.D.).

1.	JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the primary format for APIs, used to encode data structures in a way that is easily interpretable by machines. APIs predominantly rely on JSON for data exchange (Custer, 2024), (Acsany, 2024).
2.	Authentication is crucial for API security, as it verifies the identity of users accessing the API (Githaiga, 2023; Curity, N.D.).
3.	Input validation and sanitization are essential to protect against injection attacks (Tang, 2024).
4.	Rate limiting helps prevent API abuse by restricting the number of requests from a single user or IP address (Tang, 2024).
5.	Consulting API documentation is vital for successful interaction with APIs. Documentation typically includes details on endpoints, parameters, authentication methods, and expected response formats (Custer, 2024).
6.	Logging mechanisms should be implemented to capture all API requests and responses, including user identity, timestamps, and actions. Ensure that logs are securely stored and regularly reviewed (Curity, N.D.).
