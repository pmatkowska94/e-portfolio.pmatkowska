                <h2>Ethics and Regulation in the Age of Generative AI: The European Approach and Global Perspectives</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The development of computer ethics has undergone significant transformation since its early foundations in the 1940s and 1950s, when Norbert Wiener introduced the concept
  of cybernetics and anticipated the ethical challenges posed by intelligent machines (Schriffert, 2018). Over time, computer ethics has evolved into an active and ongoing dialogue
  between technological progress and societal values. What began as a philosophical inquiry has expanded into a robust framework of globally recognised principles and legally binding 
  regulations designed to govern today’s complex digital ecosystems. These include instruments such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (The European Parliament And 
  The Council, 2016), the EU AI Act (EU Artificial Intelligence Act, 2024), the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (European Commission, 2019), the European Data Governance Act 
  (European Commission, 2022), and the Data Act (European Commission, 2024). The European Union, grounded in its constitutional commitment to human dignity and fundamental rights,
  has played a leading role in embedding ethical considerations into legislation (European Parliament, 2019).  By transforming core ethical principles, such as transparency, 
  accountability, and fairness, into enforceable norms, the EU demonstrates how values can be translated into practical legal standards in the context of rapid technological advancement.
  
</p>
                <h3>The European Approach to AI Ethics and Governance</h3>
<p>
  The European Union’s approach to regulating new technologies, such as AI, online platforms, and data privacy, combines a value-driven foundation with a practical implementation strategy. 
  Instruments like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) prove that fundamental values, such as privacy and freedom of expression, can be effectively safeguarded through detailed
  compliance obligations, monitoring systems, and enforcement mechanisms.</p>
<p>The emergence of generative AI, which includes models capable of producing text, images, sound, or code, represents a new phase of technological development. Unlike traditional AI systems that merely classify or predict, generative models create new content, simulating human expression and influencing various sectors (Bandi, Adapa & Kuchi, 2023). This has introduced not only new opportunities but also serious ethical concerns (Li, Ruijs & Lu, 2022)</p>
<p>The upcoming EU AI Act, set to enter into force in 2026, constitutes a significant legislative milestone. It introduces a risk-based framework that prohibits harmful AI uses (e.g. social scoring), sets strict rules for high-risk AI applications (such as in healthcare or recruitment), and mandates transparency requirements for systems like chatbots (EU Artificial Intelligence Act, 2024). Companies must demonstrate compliance before placing these systems on the market.</p>
<p>In Europe, there is a clear distinction between binding laws (e.g. regulations and directives) and non-binding instruments like ethical guidelines. While the laws create legal certainty and enforceability, the guidelines play a key role in shaping public and industry standards (Corrêa et al., 2023). The EU’s layered governance model, beginning with ethical principles and followed by enforceable legislation, is a clear example of how voluntary and mandatory measures can work combined. </p>
<p>A major ethical challenge presented by generative AI is misinformation and deepfakes, which erode trust and increase the risk of manipulation (Alanazi et al. 2025). Another is bias and discrimination: since these models are trained on internet data, they often reproduce social biases embedded in the training sets (Ferrara, 2024). Moreover, issues related to copyright, authorship, and artistic originality are growing in significance as AI blurs the boundary between original and derivative works (Novelli et al., 2024). In addition, some generative models are trained on scraped data, including personal information, raising concerns around privacy and the principle of informed consent (Li, Ruijs & Lu, 2022). </p>
<p>Ethical frameworks demand accountability, transparency, and human oversight (European Parliament, 2019; Li, Ruijs & Lu, 2022), particularly when AI-generated content can potentially cause harm. There are also growing concerns about the social impact of AI on employment (Koski & Husso, 2018). The EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and the AI Act (2019) focus on key principles such as technical robustness and safety, transparency, fairness, privacy, environmental sustainability, and human oversight (European Commission, 2019). The AI Act is the first legal instrument to regulate general-purpose AI systems, requiring disclosures on AI-generated content and specific obligations for high-impact uses. This signifies a shift from abstract ethical values to enforceable legal standards.</p>             
                
                <h3>International Perspectives on AI Ethics and Regulation</h3>
<p>On the global level, forming a universal agreement on AI ethics remains difficult. The European Union promotes a rights-based, human-centric model (Dumitriu, 2025), while the United States prioritises innovation and market competitiveness (del Pozo & Rojas, 2025), often relying on self-regulation. The OECD’s 2019 AI Principles (OECD, 2019) and UNESCO’s 2021 Recommendation on the Ethics of AI (UNESCO, 2021) represent efforts to build common ground internationally. However, different political cultures and legal traditions affect how shared values, such as privacy or transparency, are implemented.</p>
<p>For instance, the EU views privacy as a fundamental right, leading to strong data protection laws like the GDPR, while the US lacks a federal privacy law, opting instead for a sector-specific approach. Although there is general agreement on values like fairness, accountability, and bias reduction, their interpretation and enforcement differ between jurisdictions (Correa et al., 2023). Therefore, while global principles exist, their local implementation reflects national priorities and legal systems.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
 Establishing a global legal framework for AI ethics remains a highly complex challenge. Without clear and universally accepted definitions of key concepts across countries, it is nearly impossible to set global priorities for AI development that extend beyond national or regional interests. In my view, the prospect of developing a truly worldwide legal framework, one that goes beyond voluntary guidelines and becomes enforceable law, is currently very limited.</p>
<p>Future directions should therefore focus on creating shared definitions accompanied by practical examples and guidelines that are acceptable across different regions. Such a foundation, if carefully constructed with attention to the specific challenges each part of the world faces, could eventually support the development of harmonised international regulations.</p>
<p>
Another important consideration is the pace of technological advancement. As emerging fields such as quantum computing, neurotechnology, and the metaverse evolve, computer ethics will remain a dynamic and evolving area. The global community is likely to continue following a pattern of defining ethical principles, testing them in practice, and formalising them into law where necessary.
</p>
<p>The key challenge is to maintain a balance between being principle-driven, to uphold core values, and pragmatic, to ensure these values are implemented effectively. What once was a matter of academic and professional debate is now a pressing policy concern, particularly within the European Union’s digital agenda, where ethics and law increasingly intersect.</p>
<p>
  Future efforts should focus on developing shared definitions with practical examples acceptable across regions. Such groundwork could lead to globally consistent regulatory frameworks.
