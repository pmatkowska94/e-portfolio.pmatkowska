                <h2>
                 Feedback on team dynamics
                </h2>
      <p> 
1.	How effectively did your team work? 
</p>
<p>
We collaborated effectively, dedicating at least one hour each week to discuss our project, delegate tasks, share ideas, 
  set deadlines, and address challenges. The team maintained a supportive and solution-focused dynamic, actively
  brainstorming and providing feedback on each other's contributions. While some team members were highly 
  motivated-sometimes creating pressure for others to find additional time to contribute and generate new 
  ideas-we successfully met all the assignment criteria and ensured the quality of our work.
</p>
                <p>
2.	Were there any behaviours of your team members which were particularly valuable or detrimental to the team? 
</p>
                <p>
We worked collaboratively as a team, sharing new ideas and supporting one another throughout the project.
                Weekly brainstorming sessions allowed us to discuss challenges in depth and develop effective 
                solutions. To streamline our work, we divided the group into two subgroups: a writing team and a 
                coding team. Our team leader, Natali Nikolic, facilitated our meetings efficiently by preparing 
                detailed agendas. I personally organized the first group meeting and led one session within my 
                coding subgroup. Our focus was always on mutual support, striving to develop the best code to 
                address compelling business questions, which were then professionally articulated by the writing team.
</p>
                <p>
3.	What did you learn about working in a team from this project that you will carry into your next group/team experience?
</p>
                <p>
This was my first opportunity to organize a team meeting, including our initial group meeting and a session
                  within the coding subgroup. I also presented my results, along with the work of another team member, 
                  to an audience with diverse backgrounds, making it a unique and enriching experience. This challenge
                  significantly enhanced my leadership skills and boosted my confidence in communicating and coordinating 
                  with a team.

                <h2>
                 Self-evaluation
                </h2>

                  <p>
                    As a team member, I contributed actively by sharing ideas, respecting othersâ€™ perspectives,
                    and committing fully to selected plans. I facilitated collaboration by explaining absent 
                    members' ideas and bridging communication between subgroups, ensuring alignment. I 
                    consistently came to meetings prepared, took initiative when needed, and completed all 
                    assigned tasks. Additionally, I went beyond expectations by preparing extra work, which
                    proved valuable to the team. My efforts focused on fostering effective communication, 
                    teamwork, and productivity throughout the project.
              </p>
                <h3>My greatest strengths as a team member are:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Proactive approach</li>
        <li>Adaptability</li>
        <li>Commitment to collaboration</li>
        <li>Bringing new ideas</li>
        <li>Respecting and integrating others' perspectives</li>
        <li>Supporting the team in achieving shared goals</li>
        <li>Communication skills</li>
        <li>Willingness to go beyond my assigned tasks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The group work skills I plan to work to improve are:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Leadership</li>
        <li>Presentation skills</li>
        <li>Build greater confidence in expressing my ideas</li>
        <li>Constructive feedback</li>
    </ul>
                <h2>
               My Tutor Feedback based on the peer review
                </h2>

                <p>
                  As a group, we identified strong strengths and opportunities for collaboration, 
                  which contributed to the good results in the teamwork assignment. However, they
                  noted that I could have engaged more with my peers by elaborating on challenges, 
                  exploring areas for further development, and offering additional insights into the 
                  team dynamics. This would have strengthened the overall impact of the teamwork.
