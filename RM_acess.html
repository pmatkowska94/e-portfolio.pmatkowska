                <h2>
                  Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct â€“ Accessibility Case Study
                </h2>

                
              <p>
                Software plays a crucial role in daily life, and ensuring accessibility for all users, including those
                with disabilities, is essential. The AllTogether case study from ACM: Accessibility in Software Development highlights challenges in implementing accessibility features. 
	      </p>
              <p>
               AllTogether developed a widely used web-based collaboration tool for diverse users, including schools, agencies, non-profits, and businesses. A recent update introduced an
                inline edit feature with hidden controls, designed to improve usability by reducing interface clutter. However, this change excluded users who rely on keyboard navigation, such as 
                individuals with visual or mobility impairments (Horton, n.d.).
	      </p>
								<p>
Although AllTogether had an accessibility policy, the product team failed to implement key requirements. As a result, users with disabilities faced significant difficulties. Analysing this case 
                  through the ACM Code of Ethics (ACM, 2018) and comparing it to the BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, 2022) allows for a deeper understanding of its legal, social, and professional implications.
									</p>
								<p>
                  The ACM Principle 1.1 states that computing professionals must contribute to the well-being of society, acknowledging that all individuals are stakeholders in computing 
                  (ACM, 2018). By neglecting accessibility, the AllTogether team violated this principle, effectively discriminating against users with disabilities and potentially breaching 
                  anti-discrimination laws (Horton, n.d.). Furthermore, Principle 2.3 emphasizes the importance of understanding and complying with relevant laws. Failure to address accessibility
                  concerns could lead to legal repercussions and a loss of public trust. Additionally, ACM Principle 2.2 requires professionals to ensure that their work meets ethical and technical
                  standards (ACM, 2018). The AllTogether team failed to uphold this principle, as they neglected an essential aspect of software development that impacts a significant portion 
                  of users.
									</p>
								<p>
The BCS Code of Conduct reinforces the importance of acting in the public interest, ensuring that technology benefits all users (BCS, 2022). It stresses the duty of IT professionals to protect public
                  welfare, privacy, and equal access. The AllTogether case contradicts these principles, as it excludes users with disabilities, contributing to digital inequality. 
                </p>
                Overall, such exclusion reinforces digital inequalities and limits opportunities for people with disabilities. From a professional standpoint, failing to consider all users undermines ethical responsibility, 
                damages industry credibility, and weakens consumer confidence in IT professionals.
