<h2>Research Proposal Review: Methodology, Data Collection, and Skill Development</h2>

<h3>1. Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?</h3>
<p>In the context of my project, the most relevant methodological category is descriptive research. This approach aims to expand understanding by collecting and analysing data that describes the current state of a system, in this case, CHO and iPSC bioprocesses. Descriptive research helps to map out how certain process parameters behave across different scales and cell types, which is essential before moving into model training or prediction. It allows for identifying patterns, validating observations from literature or lab work, and laying the groundwork for more advanced modelling. While the project ultimately incorporates predictive modelling, it begins with a descriptive phase focused on examining and understanding the available data to ensure that the model is built on reliable and meaningful inputs.</p>
								

<h3>2. Which data collection methods would you consider using?</h3>
<p>
Data will be collected from two main sources. CHO datasets will be obtained from publicly available databases, literature, and existing demo runs, covering a wide range of process parameters and bioreactor scales. In parallel, small-scale iPSC process data will be generated in the lab and supplemented with selected case studies from published research or collaborators. Additional information will be extracted from peer-reviewed studies to ensure the dataset includes the most relevant and reliable variables.
</p>

<h3>3. Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?</h3>
<p>
  To complete this project, I will need to build on several technical and domain-specific skills. This includes developing a deeper understanding of machine learning, especially supervised learning techniques and transfer learning, as well as gaining experience in Python programming using libraries such as scikit-learn, and SHAP for model interpretation. I will also need to refine my data preprocessing skills to clean, standardise, and align complex time-series data from different sources. Alongside this, I aim to strengthen my understanding of bioprocesses, particularly STR scale-up and iPSC culture. Finally, strong scientific communication and the ability to critically interpret literature will be essential for reporting the findings and integrating knowledge from multiple domains.

        <h2>Research Proposal Outline</h2>

<h3>Project Title:</h3>
<p>
  <strong>A Data-Driven Perspective on Predictive Bioreactor Scale-Up: From Industrial CHO Models to iPSC Applications</strong>

  <li>Importance of STRs in industrial and academic bioproduction</li>
  <li>Shift from CHO to iPSC systems in biotechnology</li>
  <li>Motivation for integrating machine learning into scale-up strategies</li>
  <li>Research gap: limited ML applications in iPSC bioprocessing</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Aim and Objectives</h3>
<p><strong>Aim:</strong></p>
<p>
  To develop and test an ML model that uses CHO bioprocess data to predict iPSC performance at larger scales through transfer learning.

  <li>CHO systems: standard model in industrial bioprocessing</li>
  <li>iPSCs: emerging but fragile, with growing industrial relevance</li>
  <li>Existing ML models for bioprocessing (CHO- and bacteria-based)</li>
  <li>Transfer learning: concept, use in biology, and relevance here</li>
  <li>Limitations of current approaches and need for cross-cell type modelling</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Methodology</h3>

<p><strong>Data Collection:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>CHO: literature, databases, demo runs (parameters: VCD, viability, P/V, volume...)</li>
  <li>iPSC: small-scale lab data (500 mL–5 L), supplemented with public case data</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preprocessing:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Data cleaning, unit standardisation, handling missing values, time-series alignment</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Model Development:</strong></p>

  <li>Cost- and time-efficient early-stage iPSC scale-up strategy</li>
  <li>Insights into key scale-sensitive variables between CHO and iPSCs</li>
  <li>ML model artefact, visual outputs, final report and presentation</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Significance</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Demonstrates value of transfer learning in bioprocess modelling</li>
  <li>Bridges two cell systems with differing complexity</li>
  <li>Reduces experimental burden in resource-limited settings</li>
  <li>Supports future work in iPSC-based bioproduction</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Ethical Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Transparent use of data with appropriate citations and permissions</li>
  <li>Model limitations clearly stated to avoid misuse</li>
  <li>Designed as a supportive tool, not a replacement for experiments</li>
  <li>Full documentation and reproducibility of results</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Timeline</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Months 1–3:</strong> Data collection, lab work, preprocessing, literature review</li>
  <li><strong>Months 3–4:</strong> Model training (CHO), fine-tuning with iPSC data</li>
  <li><strong>Months 4–5:</strong> Validation, SHAP analysis, visualisation</li>
  <li><strong>Months 5–6:</strong> Final report and presentation</li>
</ul>
